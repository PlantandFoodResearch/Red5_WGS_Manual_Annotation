# Manually annotated sequences in FASTA format

The multiple fasta files for cds, cdna, peptide contain
all gene models submitted by annotators.

For models included in specific version releases see the 
gene list file under the specific version directory.

# Files

These files contain all models and thus may contain models 
additional to the models released in any specific version
or models that have been submitted to NCBI Genbank


Acc_all_models_cdna.fasta.gz	cdna sequence - included coding region plus 5 and 3 UTR
Acc_all_models_cds.fasta.gz	cds sequence - coding region
Acc_all_models_peptide.fasta.gz	peptide sequence - predicted amino acid sequence for cds
