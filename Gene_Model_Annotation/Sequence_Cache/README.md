# Sequence Cache

The Sequence Cache contains sequences of all models annotated. For each model the following fasta sequence is available:

- cdna
- cds
- peptide

# Relationship to Assigned Gene Set Versions

The model sequences in the Sequence Cache are independent of Gene Set Version assignment and represent sequences of all models irrespective of inclusion in any give gene set version. Models included in a specific Gene Set version will be named in a list file <version>_gene_models.list.txt under individual gene sets recorded in [Gene_Sets_by_Version](../Gene_Sets_by_Version/)
