# Red5 Whole Genome Sequence Manual Annotation

A public repository for the whole genome sequence and manual annotation of Actinidia chinensis var chinensis Red5

# Purpose

The genome sequence (version 1.69.0) and manual curation of annotation of that genome version are available in NCBI Genbank under the accession number [NKQK00000000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NKQK00000000). A publication describing that genome sequence version and the manual curation of annotation will soon be published in BMC Genomics. The manual curation of Red5 gene annotation in that publication was a community effort involving approximately 94 researchers from research centers located in several countries including New Zealand, China, Italy, and Australia

Git has proven its worth for collarborative software development but has not been extensively used to date for collaborative community based gene annotation. This site is therefore a trial of that concept as a means to assist in the ongoing improvement of manually annotated gene models for *Actinidia chinensis* var *chinensis* Red5. 

# Gene Set Versioning

Gene model sets in this repository are specific to a specific whole genome sequence version. This means coordinates in gff3 files are specific to a specific whole genome sequence coordinate system and will not be correct out side that specifice whole genome sequence version.

# EnsemblPlants

The Red5 genome and annotation is also available on [EnsemblPlants](http://plants.ensembl.org/Actinidia_chinensis/Info/Index)
