A public repository for the whole genome sequence and manual annotation of Actinidia chinensis var chinensis Red5

On publication of our paper describing the manual annotation of the whole genome sequence of Actinidia chinensis var chinensis Red5 the sequences for the gene set will be ported to this repository to facility on going curation.

This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession NKQK00000000. The version described in our paper is version NKQK01000000. It willbecome visible withn NCBI on publicaiton of our paper.
